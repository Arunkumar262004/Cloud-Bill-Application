1. Import the project – Clone the project from GitHub and open it in your code editor.

2. Configure the environment – Open the .env file and update the database name and credentials to match your local setup. Also, provide your own email ID and passkey for email OTP authorization.

3. cd laravel-backend then  Start the backend server – Open a terminal in VS Code, navigate to the project directory, and run:

php artisan serve
